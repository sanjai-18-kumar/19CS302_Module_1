## AIM:
To write a C program to calculate the total marks, average, and percentage of marks obtained in seven subjects.

## Algorithm
1. Start. 
2. Declare three variable value of type int for marks. 
3. Prompt the user to enter a value. 
4. Read the value using scanf. 
5. Find total and average. 
6. Print the result 
7. End.    

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h> 
int main() { 
    int sub1, sub2, sub3, total; 
    float average; 
    scanf("%d %d %d", &sub1,&sub2,&sub3); 
    total = sub1 + sub2 + sub3; 
    average = total / 3.0; 
    printf("\nTotal : %d\n", total); 
    printf("Average : %.2f\n", average); 
    return 0; 
} 
```
